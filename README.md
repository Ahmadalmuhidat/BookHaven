# Book Heaven â€“ Complete Bookstore Management System

## Description
**Book Heaven** is a desktop-based bookstore management system I developed during my early years as a junior developer. Built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for the user interface and MySQL for backend data storage, the system was designed to simplify and digitize core bookstore operations.

The application allows for managing books, suppliers, purchases, and sales, with a focus on usability and data consistency. The backend features a normalized database schema with well-defined relationships and foreign key constraints, ensuring reliable data handling and integration with the WPF frontend. Book Heaven served as a foundational project that helped me gain hands-on experience with desktop application development, relational databases, and CRUD operations.
